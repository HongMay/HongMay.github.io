     <h1>What is the shortest Sherlock Holmes' story?</h1>
    <h2>Question:</h2>
    <p> What is the shortest <b>Sherlock Holmes'</b> story?</p>

    <h2>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:</h2>
<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle worked as a doctor before becoming an author, he wrote comics and then published his first novel A Study in Scarlet in 1887. This was when readers were first introduced to Sherlock Holmes, a character based on a professor from Doyle's medical school. Sherlock Holmes's wit, observation, and deductive reasoning not only helped him solve crimes but fascinated readers for generations.</p>

    <h2>Answer and Explanation:</h2>
<p>Technically, the shortest Sherlock Holmes story was a book written for a dollhouse in Windsor Castle. The book titled "How Watson Learned the Trick" for Queen Mary's dolls' house at Windsor Castle, is only 503 words long. The book measures 1.53 inches by 1.18 inches, and it a total of 34 tiny pages. This story is obviously not very well known since it was written for this specific occasion, but in 2014 it was published in the exact measurement that it was produced in, the first miniature version available of the story. Many other authors also wrote short stories in small books for the dollhouse, including Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling.</p>
